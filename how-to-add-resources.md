<br>

## How to add resources

<br>

**Start by selecting any one md file from the** *pages directory*. **Say for example you have selected** *full-stack-blockchain-development.md* **file.**

<br>

> Note: Now there are two possibilities, the file you selected might be a blank file if no one has contribited to it (in my case the file I selected was a blank file) or the file you selected might contain the resources added by our previous contributors.

<br>

### If the file you selected is a blank file, then follow the below steps

<br>

1. Every file must consist of one main heading (This has to be mentioned in the first line of the file) 
<br>

```
# Heading
```

<br>

2. Once you have added the main heading, we need to create a table in which we can add the description, preview and link to get started. This we can do by adding the following markdown.
<br>

```
|Description | Preview   | Link to get started with it   |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
```
<br>

> Note: If you are using VS Code Editor, you can always check the preview of the md file by pressing the keys    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>

<br>

3. Once the table creation is done, add the resources you have as shown below
<br>

```
|  1. CourseName| <center> [![CourseName](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AddVideoCode/mqdefault.jpg "CourseName")](AddVideoLink "CourseName") <center>  | [Here you go](AddVideoLink)
```

<br>

- The video code is nothing but the 11 digit/character code present at the end of every youtube video link. For example, for the following link *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphagk4O5qA* the video code is **dphagk405qA**

<br>

> Note: While adding the resources always refer to the other *md* files present in the *pages* directory. This might help you whenever you across certain issues.

<br>

If the file you selected is not an empty file, follow *step 3*
